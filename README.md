# Sudoku_Solver
This software includes a sudoku solver using the backtracking algorithm, and a graphical user interface to create interactive display. I created this software after playing sudoku from low to mid to high and then to expert level. I thought I could use my computer science skills to solve the game, and this project truly acccomplishes that. 

Intructions:
* To play the game of sudoku, run interface.py 
* Click on a box on the grid, and hit a specific number from 1-9 on the keyboard to insert in where you want on the grid. To                           confirm that number, press ENTER. To delete a number, click DEL. 
* You can observe how the backtracking algorithm solves the puzzle by pressing SPACE.
